Hello, and welcome. This is Bismuth.

 This is my second iteration to the circles project for RAS.

Unfortunately, I still haven't found a way to fix the issues I have and I don't believe I will be able to, given the time limit.

Therefore, I have decided to give up, and make something fun instead.

In the future, for some reason, I might add new tthings to the code. For now, I have 7 objects.

Have fun looking at them all, I have created all of them with my bare hands.

Bismuth out.

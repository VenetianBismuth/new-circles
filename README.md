Hello, everyone. Bismuth here.
This is supposed to be my take on the RAS Excemption Project.
However, no mattr what I did, I couldn't make my code work accordingly. There are too many issues.
Instead, I've decided to -unsurprisingly- make a meme out of it.
I've had the idea to add various memes to my code ever since I started this project. I wish I could've added them to a code that's complete.
While not chaotic to the eye, it's certainly the enemy of your ears. Enjoy.
If I have the time and interest in the near future, I will work and fix the prevalent issues.
For the time being, this is the project I'm (un)satisfied with. I hope you will be, too.
Until next time, hocams. This was Bismuth.
